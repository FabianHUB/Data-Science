    "\n",
    "This study aims to propose a machine learning model to identify risk areas for crime in Los Angeles based on historical features of the LA police crime dataset from 2020. The dataset contains more than 600,000 records of criminal incidents that were preprocessed and sampled to obtain 28,850 records for analysis. The descriptive analysis revealed some patterns and insights about the distribution of crime across different areas, types, times and victim characteristics. The study concludes that a machine learning model that can forecast the level of risk for each area based on these features is needed to optimize the allocation of police resources and prevent crime. This is a brief summary of the descriptive analysis studied in phase 1 :\n",

    "As a result, there are two important findings to consider. Firstly, in the case of F-score selection method, seems that a larger number of P will provide a better performance compare to low number of features. As evidence, it is possible to observe how the method ignores these two variables $premis code$ and $vict descent J$, with their respectively F-score 178.0760 and 144.8283. These two variable have the highest score. Therefore, for these model it is better to have a large number p. Secondly, in the mutual information method, the results appeared to be coherent from one change of p to the other.  However, it does not share the same ranking of features. For instance, their best descriptive variables are $weapon used code$ and $vict age$. "

Considering the catalog of useful model from Sklearn, it is possible to apply the similar algorithms as the Nearest Centroid which change the paradigm of the algorithm to center the neighbors and calculate the distance from the center to the observation as a classification method.\n",

    "\n",
    "Firstly, The current descriptive variables may are not able to describe the area of crime for classification. It seems that the features are correlated with the area of crime in LA but not all them are significantly for a classification task. For example the hours during the crime was issued is time variable that has an extra level of complexity and this can have effect on the modelling process. Additionally, LAPD should collect more informative features about the 21 areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite the size of the data normally provides extra information for a better model, it has also disadvantages. One of them, is that processing large dataset requires time and  operation resources from the system to run a variety of possible tunning combinations. For the scope of this project, this is a limitation using a local computer for modelling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, it is not clear limitation but multinomial target have an extra level of complexity in the model evaluation section. This is because, they do not offer many visualizations to understand the results of the metric and possible plots required a high level of programming proficiency."

    "In summary, Los Angeles Police Department criminal records is a dataset with more than 600,000 observations from 2020. This is a vast dataset that contains over 21 descriptive features describing each of the  crime incidents in the city from 2020. One of the goals of the Police Department is to guarantee citizen safety. Hence, it important to work on technology tools able to predict where a crime incidents across the city. For this reason, the scope of this project was focused on the research and experiment of machine learning models. This is because, a ML model is able to classify or predict target variable, in this case, an area that is in risk of a crime. \n",
    "\n",
    "This project was concluded in two phases, the first phase contributed to understand the characteristics of the data collected.  The second phase experimented with a range of machine learning algorithm to propose a the fittest model with the current data. This summary will describe the general points of both phases.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, Phase 1 prepared the data to be processed in ML models and it also described variables and values of the LAPD database. Initially, the data was cleaned of noisy values and tidied by removing missing values and renaming incorrect values. Then, descriptive tools were applied to identify important findings related with area descriptions and  victims demographic in the 21 areas of Los Angeles. For instance, There are areas where female population is more affected than male population. Another evidence exposed by the data explains that the area 1 of Los Angeles has a high frequency of crimes compared to the other 20 areas. From this type of analysis, the project were able to continue to next phase where all this data was processed into different machine learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, Phase 2 experimented with different algorithms including Neural Network  to determine which one fits better with the current variables. The sample data was split into training and testing following the ML procedures. After that, 4 different algorithms were tunned with their possible characteristics. This is because, tunning the algorithm improves the model to try to get the fittest model with the current knowledge and data. Finally, the 4 models were compared to identify which one performs better. For instance, the information-based algorithms worked better than other algorithm paradigms for this specific data. As a conclusion of this phase, one model performed better but it requires further development in order to be able to determine the area of crime for LAPD.\n"

    "### Findings  <a id='fffff'></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "This project generates a variety of results regarding the type of data used and the possible machine learning methods that can be applied. This a summary of this findings :\n",
    "\n",
    "* The data collected form the LAPD contains information about the type of crime and victim demography. This is include, the areas where the crime was issued. However, this project present that there are areas more affected than others among the 21 divided areas of LA.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Continuing with the data description, the mean of age fluctuates between 35 and 45 and there are areas where male population is less affected than female population.\n",
    "\n",
    "* As a result of selecting the best features, there are two important findings to consider. Firstly, in the case of F-score selection method, seems that a larger number of P will provide a better performance compare to low number of features. Secondly, in the mutual information method, the results appeared to be coherent from one change of p to the other. However, it does not share the same ranking of features.\n",
    "\n",
    "* In terms of the machine learning research, the three models were tested to create a predictive model for the LAPD. The decision tree algorithm has high accuracy and f-score which means it can capture data and predict the area of crime properly. The Naive Bayes model is not viable to use for predictions due to its insignificant F-score, accuracy score and mAP. Finally,  Although F-score of the KNN model is lower compared to previous models, the average accuracy of the model is close to 20% which is better than models based on information algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "* In addition to the previous findings, the Neural Network algorithm is another algorithm that was tested to create a predictive model for the LAPD. The Neural Network algorithm tries to simulate neural work from humans and applies it to predictive models. However, the NN algorithm seems to have an accuracy score of 0.36 which is lower than the decision tree but higher than the other models.\n",
    "\n",
    "* It is possible that the perfomance of the models woudl be better, if there more variable that describe the area of crim. For example, LAPD can collect information about industries in the area, type of communities, population size in between others. This type of variable can feed the models with more information about the area where the crime happened to predict future incidents."

    "LAPD requires a Machine Learning model that can use feature variables of time, space and descriptive variables to forecast areas that are more vulnerable to crime occurrences. The decision tree algorithm has high accuracy and f-score which means it can capture data and predict the area of crime properly. The Naive Bayes, KNN and NN are model with a low performance but they could improve if the quality of the variable improve by adding descriptive features related to the area of crime. However, approach is beneficial for the LAPD to reduce the level of crimes and guarantee the safety within the community of Los Angeles by knowing where to assign police force in the different areas of the city."
